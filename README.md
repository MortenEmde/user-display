# user-display

## Description
My take on a simple user display application with seperate REST api server.

This project was build and tested on:

npm v8.11.0

Node v16.16.0

### Set-up
1. In your terminal, clone the repo with:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/MortenEmde/user-display.git
  ```
2. Enter the repo:
  ```
  cd user-display
  ```
3. This application makes use of concurrently for easy start of client + server.  
To install dependencies and start up the application + server, in the terminal type:
  ```
  npm run start
  ```

Alternatively, you can follow the steps in the README.md of the client and server seperatelty.

__Note:__ You will need to run the _server_ to see and interact with data in the _client_
