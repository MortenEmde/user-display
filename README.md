# user-display

## Description
My take on a simple user display application with seperate REST api server.

__Note:__ You will need to run the _server_ to see and interact with data in the _client_

This project was build and tested on:

npm v8.11.0

Node v16.16.0

### Set-up
* In your terminal you can clone the repo
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/MortenEmde/user-display.git
  ```
* Enter the repo
  ```
  cd user-display
  ```

* Open a seperate terminal window

* In your first terminal, enter the server folder
  ```
  cd server
  ```
* Install node_modules
  ```
  npm install
  ```
* Run dev server
  ```
  npm start
  ```

* In your second terminal, enter the client folder
  ```
  cd client
  ```
* Install node_modules
  ```
  npm install
  ```
* Run dev server
  ```
  npm start
  ```
